# Sorting Algorithms and Big O Notation

Sorting algorithms are fundamental to computer science and are used to arrange elements of a list or an array in a specific order, such as numerical or lexicographical order. There are various sorting algorithms, each with its advantages and disadvantages in terms of efficiency and implementation complexity. One way to analyze sorting algorithms is by considering their time complexity, often expressed using Big O notation, which describes the upper bound on the time taken by an algorithm to solve a problem based on the size of the input.

This project involves the implementation of various sorting algorithms in C programming language. The implemented algorithms are required to adhere to specific coding standards, constraints, and documentation requirements outlined below.

## Project Requirements

### Coding Style
- Code follows the Betty style guide for C programming.
- No use of global variables.
- Each C file contains no more than 5 functions to maintain modularity.

### Testing
- Used provided `print_array` and `print_list` functions for testing sorting algorithms. These functions print arrays and doubly linked lists, respectively.

### Header Files
- Declared the prototypes of functions in the `sort.h` header file.
- Header files are properly include guarded to prevent multiple inclusion.

### Time Complexity Analysis
- Analyzed the time complexity of sorting algorithms using Big O notation. Use the short notation without constants.
